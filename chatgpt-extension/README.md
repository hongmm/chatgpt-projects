# ChatGPT chrome extension

## General prompts used to generate this app
1. Generate me a chrome extension that allows a user to utilize ChatGPT API in a small popup using Typescript and React.
2. Provide me a boilerplate for the extension popup.
3. I would like to structure the extension so that there is an input field as well as a button at minimum. What other primary features do you think should be included?
4. What other secondary features do you think should be added to this project? Give me some examples and a boilerplate code for them.
5. Please check my tsconfig.json and webpack.config.js to figure out potential issues with running "react-scripts build" script 

## Personal notes
Another chrome extension project I worked on. I wanted to see if I could make a quick chrome extension that would let me ping the ChatGPT API without having to go to their web app.
I decided to try out Typescript since I was unable to in my last chrome extension project and was able to do so successfully by prompting ChatGPT as well as doing some own research on the side. Adding in Typescript through create-react-app definitely streamlined some of the issues that showed up in the previous attempt. Figuring out the extension part was also much faster now that I had a completed extension under my belt and overall this project went more smoothly. Bard was helpful in this endeavor especially in its summaries providing additional information to go off of in regards to questions I've asked.
