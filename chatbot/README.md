# Chatbot web app

## General prompts used to generate this app
1. Generate a list of simple projects I can work on using Javascript and ChatGPT API.
2. From that list, I would like to develop a chatbot. Can you provide me a list of steps I need to take in order to do so?
3. Can you provide me a boilerplate for the chatbot?

## Personal notes
The first project I developed for this series. 
I had ChatGPT come up with some ideas for a web app using its API.
A very simple project but I did have to prompt it a few times regarding its API endpoint. 
Because of its data cutoff, the code ChatGPT provided in regards to the post command utilized a deprecated model and that required me to manually fix the endpoint.
All in all, a simple project that took a slight amount of troubleshooting due to the old model recommended by ChatGPT.
