# Simple calculator in Python

## General prompts used to generate this app
1. Generate a list of simple projects I can work on using Python.
2. From that list, I would like to develop a calculator. Can you provide me a list of steps I need to take in order to do so?
3. Can you provide me a boilerplate for this calculator app?

## Personal notes
Similar to the previous BMI calculator I worked on, I had ChatGPT-3.5 generate the project idea as well as the code required for the project.
Despite changing the language from Javascript to Python, the suggestions were still very similar to the previous project. I mainly decided to work on this simple project to both familiarize myself with Python as well as see how ChatGPT-3.5 would handle the change in language. It was overall a good starting point and a quick way to get my feet wet with Python.
