# BMI calculator web app

## General prompts used to generate this app
1. Generate a list of simple projects I can work on using Javascript.
2. From that list, I would like to develop a BMI calculator. Can you provide me a list of steps I need to take in order to do so?
3. Can you provide me a boilerplate for the BMI calculator app?
## Personal notes
This project was developed to see how quickly and easily ChatGPT-3.5 could develop a web app for me.
I had ChatGPT generate both the project idea as well as the code required for the project.
I utilized create-react-app to handle most of the frontend code, only adding in the bmi form to complete the project.
Given the simplicity of the project, other prompts were not required for troubleshooting and was mostly smooth sailing and this project took up to 5 minutes max to complete.
